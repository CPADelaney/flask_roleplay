RELATIONSHIP IDEAS & FUTURE EXPANSION
====================================================

1) RELATIONSHIP TUNING & COMPLEXITY
-----------------------------------
Currently, your system adjusts relationship link levels with 
simple thresholds (e.g., +1, -2). For deeper immersion, consider:

 - Personality Modifiers:
   * Each NPC might have traits like "dominant", "timid", or "cruel".
   * Store these traits in your database or config so they can 
     amplify or reduce any changes.
     Example: A "cruel" NPC might interpret innocent actions more harshly,
              leading to greater negative changes.
   * Weighted changes: 
     final_change = base_change * personality_coefficient

 - More Detailed Relationship States:
   * Instead of just "neutral", "ally", or "rival", add states like 
     "fearful respect", "untrusting alliance", "forced obedience", etc.
     The link_type can shift based on synergy between traits & actions.

 - Player & NPC Stats Integration:
   * If your system tracks stats like "Obedience" or "Confidence", use
     them to further modulate relationship changes.

 - Gradual Decay or Growth:
   * Over time, relationships might decay (e.g., losing +1 per day) 
     if there is no interaction—fostering the need for regular upkeep
     or re-engagement.

2) ADAPTIVE DECISION LOGIC
--------------------------
Your NPCDecisionEngine might currently pick from a list of available 
actions with minimal logic. To expand:

 - Behavior Heuristics:
   * Combine current mood, relationship levels, personality, 
     and external factors (time of day, location danger) to 
     produce a "score" for each potential action.

 - Long-Term Goals:
   * Define personal objectives for each NPC (e.g., "seek more power", 
     "protect the player", "gain favor with faction X").
   * Each decision can push them slightly closer to or farther from 
     their goal. This yields more believable continuity.

 - Faction or Group Influences:
   * If the NPC is part of a faction, let that faction’s stance 
     toward the player or other NPCs color the NPC’s decisions 
     (cooperate vs. sabotage, etc.).

 - Emotional State Tracking:
   * Keep a short-term mood or emotional state that’s impacted 
     by recent interactions. Example: If the player repeatedly 
     insults the NPC, mood worsens, leading to more hostile 
     action choices.

Overall, these expansions make your NPCs feel more nuanced, 
reactive, and “alive.” Even small changes—like referencing 
an NPC’s “cruelty” trait to magnify negative relationship 
responses—can yield a big difference in gameplay dynamics.
