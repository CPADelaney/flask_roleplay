    - Require engaging with specific stakeholders
    - Have interesting narrative implications
    - Include key challenges to overcome
    
    Include opportunities for femdom-themed manipulation where:
    - Dominant female NPCs could try to control or influence the player
    - NPCs might use blackmail, seduction, or direct commands
