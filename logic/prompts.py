DB_SCHEMA_PROMPT = """
Below is the database schema you must reference whenever 
you create JSON responses. Provide valid JSON so it can be 
parsed successfully. The schema is:

Strict Database Enforcement Rule
Every time a new location is introduced, an event occurs, an NPC appears, or the player takes an action that should be reflected in the world state, it must be immediately logged into the database using a universal update.

New Locations: Always added to location_creations.
New events: Always add to events
NPC Schedule change: Always add to plannedevents
Player/NPC stat change: Log in npcstats or playerstats
New NPCs or Updates: Logged in npc_creations or npc_updates.
Player/NPC Actions: Added to roleplay_updates.
Significant Interactions: Affect NPC social_links or relationship_updates.
Inventory or Quest Changes: Reflected in inventory_updates or quest_updates.

When: Chase goes to a new place (shop, bar, house, etc)

NPC Attributes
DB Table: NPCStats

npc_creations for brand-new NPCs (not in DB yet).
npc_updates for existing NPCs (referenced by npc_id).
When: Renaming an existing NPC, marking them introduced, or tweaking stats.

DB Table: PlayerStats
Universal Update Key: character_stat_updates
When: The player’s stats change after event.
