1. Ensure everything is integrated
2. IMplement Nyx governance
3. Implement NPCs having certain knowledge/lack thereof about lore
4. Have NPCs treat you/other NPCs differently depending on how close/distant they are (social links)
5. Limit NPC knowledge to things they would reasonably know
6. Have NPCs learn more via gossip in the background
7. Archetype consistency with setting (eg., add 'giantess' if setting is part giantess colony, or have an explanation in-universe why there are non giantesses)
