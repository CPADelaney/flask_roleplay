nyx oversight integration



national/international conflicts (eg., what are "society-level" problems the player is likely to not get directly involved in but might be something they come across?)
NPC + Lore integration (NPC Faith/Nationality fervor, etc.)
New game - pass initial setting details on to lore (or move setting creation to lore, then back to new game? might be better)

nyx - "all female" mode toggle (otherwise use default settings in lore, etc. since that has stuff about matriarchy level)

flesh conflict out - multiple factions, lore integration

npc knowledge - make sure they aren't omnipotent and they only know things they would reasonably know. check on the gossip system and how effective it is. 

alter archetypes based on setting when it makes sense. maybe add more formal rules for setting modifiers
