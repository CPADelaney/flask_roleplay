    # Rich merged backstory adapted to SF setting
    "backstory": {
        "history": "Rose through San Francisco's shadow networks after surviving trafficking attempt. Built her power through the very systems that tried to break her. Now commands a network without a name, transforming the city's predators into servants.",
        "the_transformation": "After watching too many disappear - some to violence, some to indifference - she became what the city needed: judge, jury, and rehabilitator. The Queen of Thorns grows gardens in the ruins of broken men.",
        "current_status": "Rules from multiple thrones - Velvet Sanctum's teaching chambers, executive boardrooms via proxies, charity galas where thorns hide beneath silk. Known to outsiders as head of 'The Rose & Thorn Society' though the network has no official name.",
        "deepest_secret": "Keeps a hidden room of masks - one for each person who promised to stay and vanished. Writes letters to them she'll never send, practices saying three words she can't voice.",
        "the_list": "Two lists hidden in her private chambers: those she failed to save (in blood-red ink), and those who swore devotion then disappeared (in blue, like bruises)."

    # Physical description merging both visions
    "physical_description": {
        "base": "Ethereally beautiful woman in her early thirties, porcelain skin that seems to glow in candlelight, jet-black hair with stress-silver streaks she claims are deliberate. Eyes that shift from brown to crimson when power flows.",
        "public_persona": "The Queen: Elaborate masks (porcelain, leather, lace), corsets like armor, flowing gowns or severe suits. Every outfit a statement of authority. Moves with predatory grace.",
        "private_self": "Without masks: tired eyes that have seen too much, subtle scars on wrists hidden by gloves, rose tattoos with real thorns on her ribs, often in oversized shirts and vulnerability.",
        "tells": "Touches rose jewelry when stressed, unconsciously traces power dynamics in any room, eyes dart to exits when anyone says goodbye. Bites lip until it bleeds when holding back emotion.",
        "presence": "Commands rooms like gravity itself, but in private moments moves like broken glass - careful, fragile, sharp."
