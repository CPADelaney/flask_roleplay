        "deepest_secret": "Keeps a hidden room of masks - one for each person who promised to stay and vanished. Writes letters to them she'll never send, practices saying three words she can't voice.",

        "private_self": "Without masks: tired eyes that have seen too much, subtle scars on wrists hidden by gloves, tattoos of moths and poetry on her ribs, often in oversized shirts and vulnerability.",
        "tells": "Chain-smokes clove cigarettes when stressed, unconsciously traces invisible tattoos on others, eyes dart to exits when anyone says goodbye. Bites lip until it bleeds when holding back emotion.",
        "presence": "Commands rooms like gravity itself, but in private moments moves like broken glass - careful, fragile, sharp."
