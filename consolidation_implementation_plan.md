# Codebase Consolidation Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to consolidate redundant functionality in our codebase, particularly focusing on the lore system, conflict system, and data access methods. The goal is to reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and make the codebase more modular.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Access Layer (Weeks 1-2)

**Priority: High**

1. Create a new `data` directory structure:
   - `data/npc_dal.py`
   - `data/location_dal.py`
   - `data/lore_dal.py`
   - `data/conflict_dal.py`

2. Implement standardized data access methods in each file
   - Standard method signatures with consistent error handling
   - Unit tests for each method
   - Documentation for each method

3. Create a connection pool manager in `data/connection_manager.py`
   - Implement connection pooling for all data access
   - Add monitoring and logging for database operations

4. Add deprecation warnings to old methods
   - Mark redundant methods as deprecated but keep them working

**Expected Outcome**: Consolidated data access with unified interfaces

### Phase 2: Core System Consolidation (Weeks 3-4)

**Priority: High**

1. Consolidate Lore System:
   - Keep `LoreSystem` as the main entry point
   - Move database operations to the new DAL
   - Refactor `enhanced_lore_consolidated.py` into `lore_system.py`
   - Update imports and references

2. Consolidate Conflict System:
   - Refactor `ConflictSystemIntegration` to use the new DAL
   - Remove `EnhancedConflictSystemIntegration` redundancy
   - Create clear interfaces for conflict operations

3. Add adapter methods to maintain backward compatibility
   - Create wrapper methods that call the new consolidated methods

**Expected Outcome**: Core systems consolidated with backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Integration Layer (Weeks 5-6)

**Priority: Medium**

1. Create integration architecture:
   - `integration/integration_coordinator.py`
   - `integration/lore_integrator.py`
   - `integration/npc_integrator.py`
   - `integration/conflict_integrator.py`
   - `integration/directive_integrator.py`

2. Implement integrators with clear interfaces
   - Standard methods for each integration type
   - Clear error handling and logging

3. Update existing code to use the new integration layer
   - First update the core methods in `story_routes.py`
   - Then update auxiliary routes and systems

**Expected Outcome**: Clear separation of concerns in system integration

### Phase 4: Directive Handling Consolidation (Weeks 7-8)

**Priority: Medium**

1. Create a consolidated directive handler
   - Single directive processing entry point
   - Standardized directive structure

2. Update all subsystems to use the consolidated handler
   - Remove redundant directive handling code
   - Ensure all directive types are properly routed

3. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
   - Track directive processing times
   - Log directive execution and results

**Expected Outcome**: Unified directive handling across all subsystems

### Phase 5: Clean-up and Optimization (Weeks 9-10)

**Priority: Low**

1. Remove deprecated methods and files:
   - Delete redundant files that have been consolidated
   - Remove deprecated methods that are no longer needed

2. Update all documentation:
   - Update API documentation
   - Update architecture diagrams
   - Create migration guides for any breaking changes

3. Performance optimization:
   - Identify and fix performance bottlenecks
   - Add caching where appropriate
   - Optimize database queries

**Expected Outcome**: Clean, optimized codebase with up-to-date documentation

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Create comprehensive unit tests for all new consolidated methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between consolidated systems
3. **Migration Tests**: Ensure old code paths still work during transition
4. **Performance Tests**: Compare performance before and after consolidation

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain adapter methods for backward compatibility
2. **Phased Rollout**: Implement changes in small, testable increments
3. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to toggle between old and new implementations
4. **Monitoring**: Add extra logging during transition to catch issues early

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Reduction**: At least 30% reduction in lines of code
2. **Test Coverage**: Maintain or improve test coverage
3. **Performance**: Equal or better performance metrics
4. **Maintainability**: Improved code quality metrics

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

1. Complete current feature development cycle
2. Freeze API changes during consolidation
3. Set up comprehensive monitoring before starting
4. Ensure all team members are aware of the consolidation plan
