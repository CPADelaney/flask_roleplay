Refined Comprehensive Documentation of the Nyx Framework
Executive Summary
Nyx is a sophisticated AI-driven interactive narrative and agent framework that orchestrates complex storytelling experiences. At its core, Nyx uses a centralized governance system to coordinate multiple specialized agents, manage player interactions, maintain consistent narratives, and adapt to user preferences. The framework employs advanced memory systems, decision engines, meta-learning capabilities, emotional modeling, and reinforcement learning to create dynamic, personalized experiences.
Core Architecture
Central Governance System (nyx_governance.py, integrate.py)
The governance system serves as the central authority that coordinates all agents and ensures narrative coherence. It:

Controls all agents (NPCs, story directors, narrative crafters, etc.)
Enforces permissions for all actions
Manages directives across all agent types
Coordinates cross-agent interactions for narrative consistency
Handles player disagreements and provides alternatives
Tracks and enhances temporal consistency
Orchestrates goal-driven behavior across multiple agents
Evaluates action impacts on narrative, character consistency, world integrity, and player experience
Generates reasoned disagreements with suggested alternatives
Coordinates agents to achieve specific goals through multi-phase plans

Module Connections: The governance system connects to all other modules as the central coordinator. It receives input from the Agent Framework in nyx/nyx_governance.py (via check_action_permission and handle_player_disagreement), processes it using decision logic in nyx/nyx_governance.py's _analyze_action_impact method, and delegates tasks to specialized agents through nyx/integrate.py's GameEventManager. It communicates with the Memory System via nyx/nyx_governance.py's _initialize_systems method and uses the Configuration System in nyx/config.py for operational parameters, imported in nyx/integrate.py. Through the Directive System's process_directives function, it issues governance-approved actions to all systems.
Agent Framework (nyx_agent_sdk.py)
The agent framework provides the foundation for specialized AI agents within Nyx:

Rich context tracking for agent state
Decision-making algorithms based on context, emotional state, and learned patterns

System Interaction Flow
The memory system's components interact in complex patterns to provide human-like memory capabilities:

Memory Creation Flow:

User input enters through the Web Application (main.py)
Input is processed by enhanced_background_chat_task in nyx_enhancements_integration.py
The task calls NyxMemoryManager.add_memory to create a memory
The add_memory call passes through memory_nyx_integration.py for governance permission
If approved, the memory is processed by IntegratedMemorySystem.add_memory in integrated.py
This triggers emotional analysis, schema application, and interference detection
The memory is stored via UnifiedMemoryManager.add_memory in core.py
The DBConnectionManager in connection.py handles the database transaction
Telemetry.record in telemetry.py tracks the operation performance


Memory Retrieval Flow:

When context is needed, enhance_context_with_memories in nyx_enhancements_integration.py is called
This calls NyxMemoryManager.retrieve_memories for relevant memories
The retrieval request passes through memory_nyx_integration.py for governance permission
If approved, IntegratedMemorySystem.retrieve_memories in integrated.py processes the request
This triggers emotional context, memory competition, and flashback checks
Memories are retrieved via UnifiedMemoryManager.retrieve_memories in core.py
Retrieved memories are processed by ReconsolidationManager in reconsolidation.py
The memories are interpreted through schemas via MemorySchemaManager in schemas.py
The enhanced context is returned for use in response generation


Maintenance Flow:

Scheduled maintenance is triggered via nyx_memory_maintenance_task in nyx_enhancements_integration.py
This processes conversations via perform_memory_maintenance
For each entity, IntegratedMemorySystem.run_memory_maintenance is called
This triggers core maintenance, schema maintenance, emotional decay, reconsolidation, and interference processing
Old memories are archived or deleted based on significance and access patterns
Schemas are evolved or merged based on new evidence
Telemetry data is cleaned up to manage database size
Performance metrics are collected for system optimization


Progressive Revelation Flow:

During interactions, check_for_automated_reveals in masks.py may trigger
This evaluates each NPC's mask integrity and context for potential reveals
If a reveal is appropriate, generate_mask_slippage creates a revelation event
The revelation is stored in the NPC's memory via UnifiedMemoryManager.add_memory
A journal entry is created for the player to record the observation
The NPC's mask integrity is reduced, affecting future interactions
This information influences future NPC behavior and narrative progression


Schema Evolution Flow:

As new memories are added, schemas are applied via apply_schema_to_memory in schemas.py
Periodically, detect_schema_from_memories analyzes patterns in memories
If conflicts are found, find_schema_conflicting_memories identifies the issues
These conflicts trigger evolve_schema_from_conflicts to update the schema
If schemas become very similar, merge_schemas combines them into a more comprehensive model
Schema maintenance runs periodically through run_schema_maintenance
These evolving schemas influence memory interpretation, reconsolidation, and recall



This interaction flow demonstrates how the memory components work together to create a sophisticated, psychologically realistic memory system that enhances narrative experiences through dynamic memory processes.
