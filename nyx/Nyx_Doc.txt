Refined Comprehensive Documentation of the Nyx Framework
Executive Summary
Nyx is a sophisticated AI-driven interactive narrative and agent framework that orchestrates complex storytelling experiences. At its core, Nyx uses a centralized governance system to coordinate multiple specialized agents, manage player interactions, maintain consistent narratives, and adapt to user preferences. The framework employs advanced memory systems, decision engines, meta-learning capabilities, emotional modeling, and reinforcement learning to create dynamic, personalized experiences.
Core Architecture
Central Governance System (nyx_governance.py, integrate.py)
The governance system serves as the central authority that coordinates all agents and ensures narrative coherence. It:

Controls all agents (NPCs, story directors, narrative crafters, etc.)
Enforces permissions for all actions
Manages directives across all agent types
Coordinates cross-agent interactions for narrative consistency
Handles player disagreements and provides alternatives
Tracks and enhances temporal consistency
Orchestrates goal-driven behavior across multiple agents
Evaluates action impacts on narrative, character consistency, world integrity, and player experience
Generates reasoned disagreements with suggested alternatives
Coordinates agents to achieve specific goals through multi-phase plans

Module Connections: The governance system connects to all other modules as the central coordinator. It receives input from the Agent Framework in nyx/nyx_governance.py (via check_action_permission and handle_player_disagreement), processes it using decision logic in nyx/nyx_governance.py's _analyze_action_impact method, and delegates tasks to specialized agents through nyx/integrate.py's GameEventManager. It communicates with the Memory System via nyx/nyx_governance.py's _initialize_systems method and uses the Configuration System in nyx/config.py for operational parameters, imported in nyx/integrate.py. Through the Directive System's process_directives function, it issues governance-approved actions to all systems.
Agent Framework (nyx_agent_sdk.py)
The agent framework provides the foundation for specialized AI agents within Nyx:
