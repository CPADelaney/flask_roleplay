1. Enable any number of factions to take place in a conflict (can be 0 for interpersonal, can be 10+ for an 'all out war')
2. Add the ability for a conflict to require multiple different types of specialized resources
3. Make narrative-progression NPC specific (eg., the veil doesn't necessarily thin across the board; you can still have somewhat normal interactions with people not actively 'working on' you)
4. Link agent to Nyx for governance
5. Integrate other agents for context (eg setting, relationships, npcs, etc; this might be the same as #4?)
