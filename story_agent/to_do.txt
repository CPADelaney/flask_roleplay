1. Enable any number of factions to take place in a conflict (can be 0 for interpersonal, can be 10+ for an 'all out war')
2. Add the ability for a conflict to require multiple different types of specialized resources
3. Make narrative-progression NPC specific (eg., the veil doesn't necessarily thin across the board; you can still have somewhat normal interactions with people not actively 'working on' you)
