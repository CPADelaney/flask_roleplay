To address the `bandit` issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on the use of weak MD5 hashes and possible SQL injection vectors.

### Patch 1: Use of Weak MD5 Hash

#### File: `./context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False)
```

#### File: `./context/memory_manager.py`

```diff
330c330
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False)
```

```diff
411c411
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False)
```

### Patch 2: Possible SQL Injection Vector

#### File: `./data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
<     query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % name
---
>     query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s"
>     cursor.execute(query, (name,))
```

### Patch 3: Try, Except, Pass Detected

#### File: `./context/vector_service.py`

```diff
312c312
<     try:
<         # some code
<     except SomeException:
<         pass
---
>     try:
>         # some code
>     except SomeException as e:
>         logger.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

These patches address some of the critical issues identified by `bandit`. For a comprehensive fix, similar changes should be applied to other instances of these issues throughout the codebase.
