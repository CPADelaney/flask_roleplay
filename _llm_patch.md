To address the static analysis issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on replacing the use of weak MD5 hashes and addressing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Patch 1: Replace MD5 with a more secure hash function

#### File: `context/context_manager.py`

```diff
- import hashlib
+ import hashlib, hmac

- md5_hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
+ md5_hash = hmac.new(key=b'secret_key', msg=data, digestmod=hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: Address SQL Injection Vulnerability

#### File: `data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
- query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % user_input
+ query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s"
+ cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

### Patch 3: Replace standard pseudo-random generators with secure ones

#### File: `logic/addiction_system_sdk.py`

```diff
- import random
+ import secrets

- random_value = random.randint(0, 100)
+ random_value = secrets.randbelow(101)
```

These patches address critical security issues by replacing weak cryptographic functions and preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities. Make sure to review and test these changes in your environment.
