To address the static analysis issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact issues. Let's focus on the use of weak MD5 hashes and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Patch 1: Use of weak MD5 hash

For the MD5 hash issues, we can switch to a more secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256. Here's a patch for `./context/context_manager.py`:

```diff
--- a/context/context_manager.py
+++ b/context/context_manager.py

 import hashlib
 
 def generate_hash(data):
-    return hashlib.md5(data.encode()).hexdigest()
+    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: SQL Injection Vulnerability

For SQL injection issues, we should use parameterized queries. Here's a patch for `./data/npc_dal.py`:

```diff
--- a/data/npc_dal.py
+++ b/data/npc_dal.py
@@ -609,7 +609,8 @@
 def get_npc_by_name(name):
     cursor = connection.cursor()
-    query = f"SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = '{name}'"
+    query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = %s"
     cursor.execute(query, (name,))
     return cursor.fetchone()
```

These patches address critical security vulnerabilities by replacing weak hashing algorithms and preventing SQL injection attacks. Apply similar changes to other files with similar issues.
