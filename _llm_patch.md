To address the static analysis issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on replacing weak MD5 hash usage and addressing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Patch 1: Replace MD5 with a more secure hash function

#### File: `context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
- import hashlib
+ import hashlib, hmac

...

102c102
- hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
+ hash = hmac.new(b'secret_key', data, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: Address SQL Injection Vulnerability

#### File: `data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
- query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = '%s'" % name
+ query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = ?"
+ cursor.execute(query, (name,))
```

### Patch 3: Replace Standard Random Generators with Secure Ones

#### File: `logic/addiction_system_sdk.py`

```diff
490c490
- import random
+ import secrets

...

490c490
- random_value = random.randint(0, 100)
+ random_value = secrets.randbelow(101)
```

These patches address some of the critical security issues identified by `bandit`. Make sure to test these changes thoroughly to ensure they don't introduce new issues.
