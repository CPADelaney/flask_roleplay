To address some of the security issues identified by `bandit`, here are a few patches in unified diff format:

### Patch 1: Use of weak MD5 hash for security

For files using MD5 for security purposes, consider using a stronger hash function like SHA-256. If MD5 is not used for security, set `usedforsecurity=False`.

 def some_function():
-    hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
+    hash = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: Possible SQL injection vector

For SQL injection issues, use parameterized queries instead of string-based query construction.

+    query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE id = %s"
     cursor.execute(query, (npc_id,))
     return cursor.fetchone()
```

### Patch 3: Standard pseudo-random generators not suitable for security

Replace `random` with `secrets` for cryptographic purposes.

```

### Patch 4: Try, Except, Pass detected

Avoid using bare `except` and `pass`. Handle specific exceptions or log them.

These patches address some of the critical security issues identified. Further patches can be created for other issues following similar patterns.
