I don’t see any lint errors or context snippets listed in your message – could you please paste the specific lint failures (and the relevant code snippets) you’d like me to address?  

In the meantime, here’s a minimal, high-impact patch to bootstrap consistent linting across the repo (adds Black, isort and Flake8 via pre-commit, plus a GitHub Actions workflow). You can apply this immediately to start catching and auto-fixing style issues, and once you have your specific lint failures you can iteratively add or tighten rules:

Once you share the specific lint errors and code snippets, I can propose targeted fixes for each.
