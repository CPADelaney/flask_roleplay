To address the static analysis issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on the use of weak MD5 hashes and possible SQL injection vectors, as these are critical security concerns.

### Patch 1: Use of weak MD5 hash

#### File: `./context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
<     hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
```

#### File: `./context/memory_manager.py`

```diff
330c330
<     hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
411c411
<     hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: Possible SQL injection vector

#### File: `./data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
<     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = '%s'" % name
---
>     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = %s"
>     cursor.execute(query, (name,))
```

These patches address the use of weak MD5 hashes by setting `usedforsecurity=False` and mitigate SQL injection risks by using parameterized queries. Apply similar changes to other instances in the codebase where these issues are detected.
