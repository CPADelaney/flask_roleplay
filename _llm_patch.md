To address the `bandit` issues related to the use of weak MD5 hashes, here's a patch suggestion for one of the files. The same approach can be applied to other instances.

### Patch for `./context/context_manager.py:102`

```diff

 import hashlib

 def some_function():
-    hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
+    hash = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
     return hash
```

### Explanation

- **MD5 Hash**: The patch adds `usedforsecurity=False` to the `hashlib.md5()` call to indicate that the MD5 hash is not being used for security purposes, which addresses the `B324` issue.

Apply similar changes to other instances where MD5 is used. If MD5 is being used for security purposes, consider switching to a more secure hash function like SHA-256.

If you need patches for other issues, please specify which ones you'd like to address next.
