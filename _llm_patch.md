To address the static analysis issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact issues. Let's focus on replacing weak MD5 hashes and addressing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Patch for Weak MD5 Hash (B324)

For the MD5 hash issues, we can replace the MD5 usage with a more secure hash function like SHA-256. Here's a patch for `context/context_manager.py`:

```diff

+++ b/context/context_manager.py

 import hashlib

 def generate_hash(data):
-    return hashlib.md5(data.encode()).hexdigest()
+    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()
```

### Patch for SQL Injection (B608)

For SQL injection issues, we should use parameterized queries. Here's a patch for `data/npc_dal.py`:

```diff
--- a/data/npc_dal.py
+++ b/data/npc_dal.py
@@ -609,7 +609,8 @@
 def get_npc_by_name(name):
     cursor = connection.cursor()
-    query = f"SELECT * FROM npcs WHERE name = '{name}'"
+    query = "SELECT * FROM npcs WHERE name = %s"
+    cursor.execute(query, (name,))
     return cursor.fetchone()
```

These patches address critical security vulnerabilities by replacing weak cryptographic functions and preventing SQL injection attacks. Consider applying similar changes to other files with similar issues.
