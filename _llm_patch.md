To address the `bandit` issues, I'll suggest patches for a few key problems. Let's focus on the following:

1. **Use of weak MD5 hash for security**: Consider using `usedforsecurity=False`.
2. **Try, Except, Pass detected**: Add logging or proper error handling.
3. **Possible SQL injection vector**: Use parameterized queries.

### Patch for MD5 Hash Usage

 def some_function():

### Patch for Try, Except, Pass

```

### Patch for SQL Injection

```

These patches address the issues by improving security and error handling. Apply similar changes to other instances as needed.
