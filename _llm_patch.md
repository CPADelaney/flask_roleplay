To address the static analysis issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact issues. Let's focus on the use of weak MD5 hashes and possible SQL injection vectors.

### Patch 1: Use of weak MD5 hash

For files using MD5 for security purposes, replace it with a stronger hash function like SHA-256.

#### File: `./context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
<     hash_value = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash_value = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

#### File: `./context/memory_manager.py`

```diff
330c330
<     hash_value = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash_value = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

```diff
411c411
<     hash_value = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash_value = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: Possible SQL injection vector

For SQL injection issues, use parameterized queries instead of string-based query construction.

#### File: `./data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
<     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = '%s'" % name
---
>     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = ?"
>     cursor.execute(query, (name,))
```

### Patch 3: Try, Except, Pass detected

Replace `try, except, pass` with proper error handling or logging.

#### File: `./context/vector_service.py`

```diff
312c312
<     try:
<         # some code
<     except SomeException:
<         pass
---
>     try:
>         # some code
>     except SomeException as e:
>         logger.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

These patches address critical security issues and improve code robustness. Apply similar changes to other instances of these issues throughout the codebase.
