To address the `bandit` issues, I'll provide patches for some of the most critical ones, focusing on security vulnerabilities like weak MD5 hash usage and SQL injection risks.

### Patch for Weak MD5 Hash Usage

#### File: `./context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False)
```

#### File: `./context/memory_manager.py`

```diff
330c330
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False)
```

```diff
411c411
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False)
```

#### File: `./context/vector_service.py`

```diff
168c168
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False)
```

### Patch for SQL Injection Risks

#### File: `./data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
<     query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % name
---
>     query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s"
>     cursor.execute(query, (name,))
```

#### File: `./logic/conflict_system/conflict_integration.py`

```diff
735c735
<     query = "DELETE FROM records WHERE id = '%s'" % record_id
---
>     query = "DELETE FROM records WHERE id = %s"
>     cursor.execute(query, (record_id,))
```

### Patch for Insecure Random Generators

For the `B311` issues related to insecure random generators, consider using `secrets` or `os.urandom` for cryptographic purposes.

#### Example Replacement

```diff
- import random
+ import secrets

- random_value = random.randint(0, 100)
+ random_value = secrets.randbelow(101)
```

These patches address some of the critical security issues identified by `bandit`. Further patches can be applied similarly to other files with similar issues.
