To address the static analysis issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact issues. Let's focus on replacing weak MD5 hash usage and addressing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Patch 1: Replace MD5 with a more secure hash function

#### File: `./context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data)
```

#### File: `./context/memory_manager.py`

```diff
330c330
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data)

411c411
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data)
```

#### File: `./context/vector_service.py`

```diff
168c168
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data)
```

### Patch 2: Prevent SQL Injection by using parameterized queries

#### File: `./data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
<     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = '" + name + "'"
---
>     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = %s"
>     cursor.execute(query, (name,))
```

### Patch 3: Replace standard pseudo-random generators with secure ones

#### File: `./logic/addiction_system_sdk.py`

```diff
490c490
<     random_value = random.random()
---
>     random_value = secrets.randbelow(100) / 100
```

These patches address some of the critical security issues identified by `bandit`. For a comprehensive fix, similar changes should be applied to other instances of these issues throughout the codebase.
