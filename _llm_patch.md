To address the static analysis issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on replacing weak MD5 hash usage and addressing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Patch 1: Replace MD5 with a more secure hash function

#### File: `./context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data)
```

#### File: `./context/memory_manager.py`

```diff
330c330
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data)

411c411
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data)
```

#### File: `./context/vector_service.py`

```diff
168c168
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.sha256(data)
```

### Patch 2: Prevent SQL Injection by using parameterized queries

#### File: `./data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
<     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = '%s'" % name
---
>     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = ?"
>     cursor.execute(query, (name,))
```

These patches replace the insecure MD5 hash with SHA-256 and modify a SQL query to use parameterized inputs, reducing the risk of SQL injection. Apply similar changes to other instances of these issues throughout the codebase.
