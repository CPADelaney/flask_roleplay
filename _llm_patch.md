To address the `bandit` issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on the use of weak MD5 hashes and potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Patch 1: Use of weak MD5 hash

For the MD5 hash issues, we can switch to a more secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256. Here's a patch for `context/context_manager.py`:

```diff

+++ b/context/context_manager.py

 import hashlib

 def generate_hash(data):
-    return hashlib.md5(data.encode()).hexdigest()
+    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: Possible SQL injection vector

For SQL injection issues, we should use parameterized queries. Here's a patch for `data/npc_dal.py`:

```diff
--- a/data/npc_dal.py
+++ b/data/npc_dal.py

 def get_npc_by_name(name):
     connection = get_db_connection()
     cursor = connection.cursor()
-    query = f"SELECT * FROM npcs WHERE name = '{name}'"
+    query = "SELECT * FROM npcs WHERE name = ?"
+    cursor.execute(query, (name,))
     result = cursor.fetchone()
     connection.close()
     return result
```

These patches address critical security issues by replacing weak cryptographic practices and preventing SQL injection attacks. Let me know if you need further assistance!
