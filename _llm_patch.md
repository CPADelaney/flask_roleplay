To address the static analysis issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on the use of weak MD5 hashes and possible SQL injection vectors.

### Patch 1: Use of weak MD5 hash

#### File: `./context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False)
```

#### File: `./context/memory_manager.py`

```diff
330c330
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False)
```

```diff
411c411
<     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data)
---
>     hash_object = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False)
```

### Patch 2: Possible SQL injection vector

#### File: `./data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
<     query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % user_input
---
>     query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s"
>     cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

### Patch 3: Use of standard pseudo-random generators

#### File: `./logic/addiction_system_sdk.py`

```diff
490c490
<     random_value = random.random()
---
>     random_value = secrets.randbelow(100)
```

These patches address the identified issues by:

1. Adding `usedforsecurity=False` to MD5 hash usage to indicate non-security purposes.
2. Using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
3. Replacing `random` with `secrets` for cryptographic purposes.

Apply similar changes to other instances as needed.
