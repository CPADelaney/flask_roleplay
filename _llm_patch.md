To address the static analysis issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on the use of weak MD5 hashes and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Patch 1: Use of Weak MD5 Hash

#### File: `./context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
<     hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
```

#### File: `./context/memory_manager.py`

```diff
330c330
<     hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()

411c411
<     hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: SQL Injection Vulnerability

#### File: `./data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
<     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = '%s'" % name
---
>     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = %s"
>     cursor.execute(query, (name,))
```

### Patch 3: Try, Except, Pass Detected

#### File: `./context/vector_service.py`

```diff
312c312
<     try:
<         # some code
<     except Exception:
<         pass
---
>     try:
>         # some code
>     except Exception as e:
>         logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

These patches address the use of weak MD5 hashes by setting `usedforsecurity=False`, mitigate SQL injection by using parameterized queries, and improve error handling by logging exceptions instead of passing silently.
