To address the `bandit` issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas:

### Issue: Use of weak MD5 hash for security
**File:** `./context/context_manager.py:102`

```diff
- import hashlib
+ import hashlib

- hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
+ hash = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
```

### Issue: Possible SQL injection vector through string-based query construction
**File:** `./data/npc_dal.py:609`

```diff
- query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % user_input
+ query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s"
+ cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

### Issue: Standard pseudo-random generators are not suitable for security/cryptographic purposes
**File:** `./logic/addiction_system_sdk.py:490`

```diff
- import random
+ import secrets

- random_value = random.randint(0, 100)
+ random_value = secrets.randbelow(101)
```

### Issue: Try, Except, Pass detected
**File:** `./context/vector_service.py:312`

```diff
- try:
-     risky_operation()
- except SomeException:
-     pass
+ try:
+     risky_operation()
+ except SomeException as e:
+     logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

These patches address security vulnerabilities by using more secure libraries and practices. Adjustments are made to ensure that exceptions are logged, and SQL queries are parameterized to prevent injection attacks.
