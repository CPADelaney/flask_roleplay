To address the `bandit` issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on the use of weak MD5 hashes and possible SQL injection vectors.

### Weak MD5 Hashes

For the MD5 hash issues, the recommendation is to use `usedforsecurity=False` if MD5 is not used for security purposes. If it is, consider using a stronger hash like SHA-256.

#### Patch for `context/context_manager.py:102`

 def some_function():
-    hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
+    hash = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()
     return hash
```

### SQL Injection

For SQL injection issues, use parameterized queries instead of string-based query construction.

#### Patch for `data/npc_dal.py:609`

```diff

     cursor = connection.cursor()

+    query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE id = %s"
     cursor.execute(query, (npc_id,))
     return cursor.fetchone()
```

These patches address the specific issues raised by `bandit` for weak MD5 usage and potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. Consider applying similar changes to other instances in the codebase.
