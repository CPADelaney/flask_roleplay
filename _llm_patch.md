To address the `bandit` issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on the use of weak MD5 hashes and possible SQL injection vectors.

### Patch 1: Use of weak MD5 hash

For files using MD5, consider using a more secure hash function like SHA-256. If MD5 is necessary for non-security purposes, set `usedforsecurity=False`.

#### File: `./context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
<     hash_value = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash_value = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

#### File: `./context/memory_manager.py`

```diff
330c330
<     hash_value = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash_value = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()

411c411
<     hash_value = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash_value = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: Possible SQL injection vector

For SQL injection issues, use parameterized queries instead of string-based query construction.

#### File: `./data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
<     query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % user_input
---
>     query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s"
>     cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

#### File: `./logic/conflict_system/conflict_integration.py`

```diff
735c735
<     query = "DELETE FROM records WHERE id = '%s'" % record_id
---
>     query = "DELETE FROM records WHERE id = %s"
>     cursor.execute(query, (record_id,))
```

These patches address critical security issues by replacing weak hash functions and preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities. Apply similar changes to other instances in the codebase as needed.
