Iâ€™m going to need the specific lint errors and the relevant code snippets in order to propose precise, minimal patches. Could you please share:

1. The lint warnings/errors (including file paths and rule names).  
2. The surrounding code for each issue.

Once I have those, I can draft unified-diff patches to clean them up.
