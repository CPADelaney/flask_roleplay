To address the static analysis issues, I'll provide patches for some of the high-impact issues. Let's focus on the following:

1. **Use of weak MD5 hash for security**: Update to use a more secure hash function.
2. **Possible SQL injection**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
3. **Standard pseudo-random generators not suitable for security**: Use a cryptographic random generator.

### Patch 1: Use of weak MD5 hash for security

#### File: `context/context_manager.py`

```diff
- import hashlib
+ import hashlib, hmac

- hash = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
+ hash = hmac.new(key, data, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: Possible SQL injection

#### File: `data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
- query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s'" % user_name
+ query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?"
+ cursor.execute(query, (user_name,))
```

### Patch 3: Standard pseudo-random generators not suitable for security

#### File: `logic/addiction_system_sdk.py`

```diff
- import random
+ import secrets

- random_value = random.random()
+ random_value = secrets.randbelow(100)
```

These patches address the security concerns by replacing insecure practices with more secure alternatives. Make sure to test these changes thoroughly to ensure they integrate well with the existing codebase.
