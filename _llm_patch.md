To address the identified issues, I'll suggest patches for a few high-impact areas. Let's focus on the use of weak MD5 hashes and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Patch 1: Use of Weak MD5 Hash

For files using MD5 for hashing, consider using a stronger hash function like SHA-256. If MD5 is necessary for non-security purposes, set `usedforsecurity=False`.

#### File: `./context/context_manager.py`

```diff
102c102
<     hash_value = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash_value = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

#### File: `./context/memory_manager.py`

```diff
330c330
<     hash_value = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash_value = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()

411c411
<     hash_value = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
---
>     hash_value = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

### Patch 2: SQL Injection Vulnerability

For SQL injection issues, use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation.

#### File: `./data/npc_dal.py`

```diff
609c609
<     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = '" + name + "'"
---
>     query = "SELECT * FROM npc WHERE name = %s"
>     cursor.execute(query, (name,))
```

### Patch 3: Try, Except, Pass Detected

Avoid using bare `except` clauses and ensure exceptions are handled properly.

#### File: `./context/vector_service.py`

```diff
312c312
<     try:
<         # some code
<     except:
<         pass
---
>     try:
>         # some code
>     except SpecificException as e:
>         # handle exception
```

These patches address critical security issues and improve the overall code health. Consider reviewing other similar issues in the codebase for consistent improvements.
